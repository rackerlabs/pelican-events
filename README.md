# Pelican-Events

Pelican-Events is a plugin for pelican to add the abilty to have events shown
on your website.

# What it Does

By creating an events directory and specifying it in your `pelicanconf.py` file
you create the basis for listing meetings, hangouts, conferences, etc. on your
site - generated by Pelican and output as static HTML. 


# Installation 

Once the repo is cloned, copy the pelican-events directory to the (or one of
the) path specified in `PLUGIN_PATH`, or add the path of the checkout to the
`PLUGIN_PATHS` variable.


# Configuration

Event-specific requried configuration variables with good defaults are:

```python
EVENT_DIR="events"
EVENT_URL="events/{slug}.html"
EVENT_SAVE_AS = 'events/{slug}.html'
EVENT_EXCLUDES=''
```


To create an event you will create a JSON file with a filename suffix of
'.event' in this directory. It will need to have a minimum set of fields in
order to meet the basic criteria, as seen in `contents.py`.


# Template

With these bits in place you can now use the template engine to generate
per-event pages. The default template is `event.html`. Coming soon will be an
`events.html` option to specify a template for generating a list of all events
- much the same as is done with blog posts.

Included in the plugin is a `templates` directory with a sample `event.html`
template. It is very minimal showing just the basic details of the event. It is
intended to provide a starting point for how to use the module in templates.
